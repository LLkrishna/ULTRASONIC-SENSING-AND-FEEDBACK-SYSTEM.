Introduction:

Security has always been a paramount concern for individuals and establishments alike. With the advent of high-tech and IoT-based security and surveillance systems, there's a wide array of options available in the market. The "Home Automation Security" project aims to provide an additional layer of security using an ultrasonic sensor, integrated with a Java AWT interface.

Identification of Problem Statement:

In light of the ever-present security concerns, there's a need for innovative solutions that integrate seamlessly with existing security setups. The project aims to address this need by introducing a motion detection feature based on an ultrasonic sensor, complemented by a user-friendly interface developed using Java AWT.

Identification of Required Components:

1. Arduino Board
2. Breadboard
3. Ultrasonic Sensor
4. Buzzer
5. Jumper Wires
6. LED Light
7. USB cable for Arduino or 12V, 1A adapter


Working Principle:

The system utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect motion. When an object enters the sensor's range, it triggers the Arduino microcontroller, which then activates the buzzer to emit an alert. Simultaneously, the Java AWT interface displays real-time information about the detected object's angle and distance, providing users with a comprehensive overview of the security situation.
